# Navigation Mesh Visualizer

This program implements and visualizes a basic navigation mesh based pathfinding system. A* is used as the pathfinding algorithm.
Check the console window of the program for instructions on how to use it. An example navigation mesh file is included in the repository, but other meshes can also be used.
A prebuilt Windows executable can be downloaded from the Github Releases tab.

Requires [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm), [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/) and [TinyObjLoader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader) to build. The Glad OpenGL version must be 3.3 or higher.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate how navigation meshes can be used for pathfinding in three-dimensional video game environments.
